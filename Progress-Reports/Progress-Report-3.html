    <h1>Progress Report III</h1>
    <hr>
		<p>	I have finished the Javascript part of the course assignment. 
			The goal I made for myself is to set up an array that I would use to call a random string of answers from the list to respond when the user triggers an event.
			I made the button trigger that function, and if I were to go back I would plan on clicking the 8-Ball image to be the one to trigger that function.
			As what I have right now, I believe I already demonstrate my understanding of the languages: <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JS</b> work independently but are used together to create a web page.
			<b>HTML</b> maps out text, chars, and strings as you would see in an ordinary word document or notepad. 
			Meanwhile, CSS sets themes and aesthetic for the page so the information provided in the HTML sheet stands out and is more organized.
			Then lastly, JS stores data and triggers events if the conditions are met. In theory, it can be used as a calculator, conversion table, application form, or even as a timer.
