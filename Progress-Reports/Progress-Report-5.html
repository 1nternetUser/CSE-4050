    	<h1>Progress Report V</h1>
    	<hr>
	<p>	Originally for this week's Progress Report, I have been meaning to do Firebase Hosting and Firebase Authentication in one submission. 
        However, I had severe complications in making my web page demo actually work. It took me and three other students to figure out what was my issue with the web page.
        Nevertheless, it finally worked, and I plan on solving Authentication in one week from today. I give my GitHub and Firebase pages different (progress report and other version) links to show its differences.
