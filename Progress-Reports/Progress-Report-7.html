    <h1>Progress Report VII</h1>
    	<hr>
	<p>	
			  In this Progress Report, I completed the Cloud Firestore and hopefully the 1st Web App Assignment. 
		Getting it on Firebase just got a lot easier. To demonstrate I am using Cloud Firestore, I had the user write down his/her question and it can recite it back to you. 
    The only real issue with this assignment is what exactly are you expecting for an assignment that's Web App material? Do I need to decorate it with CSS? 
    Are you expecting to see hefty source code? 
    I used my previous assignment to be my Web App, but if it's not allowed I can just make a website that does conversion tables instead for the next one. 
    Just Email me back if you want things changed.
