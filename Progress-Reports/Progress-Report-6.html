    <h1>Progress Report VI</h1>
    	<hr>
	<p>	
			  In this Progress Report, I went and did Firebase Hosting Authentication. 
		At the moment, I was not able to find out how to submit it on Firebase's Hosting URL like the last assignment so I'm going to put it in GitHub for the time being so I won't be late on submitting something this week.
		I have the same students helping me with my Hosting issues, but we keep finding errors that never happened to them before and I showed them all my coding and versions to make sure it's working fine. 
		I feel like this part of the course is the most tedious since I'm not really doing my own coding; it's just me copy and pasting codes from the website and make sure they're align to the right version. 
		I understand the importance of learning the steps of hosting a server, but this isn't as simple as most tutorial videos are making it out to be. 
		Nevertheless, once the issue is resolved, the Authentication assignment will be updated as well as the rest of the future assignments.

		<b>Update:</b> I finally got it to work on Firebase. The link is right below.
