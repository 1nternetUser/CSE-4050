    <h1>Progress Report II</h1>
    <hr>
	  <h2> <u>Disclaimer</u>: I have not been enrolled in this class until the <i>4th</i> week, so please excuse the missing previous <b>Progress Report</b>.</h2>
		<p>	I have some experience with <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> due to a previous <i>Web Development</i> class in <b>Fall 2018</b>. 
			Due to this, I have decided to submit my report in <b>HTML</b> to better recall my skills and demonstrate my progress with the <i><b>HTML</b> Assignment</i>. 
			I have also put the report on a different color to demonstrate my skills on <b>CSS</b>. 
			This will be a one time thing; it won't be on other reports if this is bothersome to read.
