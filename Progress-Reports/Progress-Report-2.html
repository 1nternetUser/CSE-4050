    <h1>Progress Report II</h1>
    <hr>
        <h1> Disclaimer: I have not been enrolled in this class until the 4th week, so please excuse the missing previous Progress Report.<h1>
        <p>    I have some experience with HTML and CSS due to a previous Web Development class in Fall 2018. 
                Due to this, I have decided to submit my report in HTML to better recall my skills and demonstrate my progress with the <i>HTML Assignment</i>. 
		I have also put the report on Dark Mode to demonstrate my skills on <i>CSS</i>. Dark Mode will be a one time thing. It won't be on the other reports if this bothers you.
