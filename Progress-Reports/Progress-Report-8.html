    <h1>Progress Report VII</h1>
    	<hr>
	<p>	
			  In this Progress Report, I updated the Firebase Login for the assignment Web App 2. 
		What I did for it was make the US values convert to the Metric system's. Then I turned it to my reading log where there's tags that will automatically scroll you to the book
    I want to resume to. Additionally, I add a CSS file to make it more appealing to me.
