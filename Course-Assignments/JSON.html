<h1>JSON Coding</h1>

<p><u>Below is a String written in JSON format: </u></p>
<p id="Data"></p>
<script>
  var txt = '{"FirstName":"Francys", "MidName":"Keith", "LastName":"Cunanan", "Age": 23, "City":"Beaumont"}'
  var obj = JSON.parse(txt);
  document.getElementById("Data").innerHTML = 
                                              "Name: "  + obj.FirstName + 	" "
                                                        + obj.MidName   +	" "
                                                        + obj.LastName  +   	", " + 
                                              "Age: " 	+ obj.Age       +   	", " + 
                                              "City: "	+ obj.City;
</script>

<p><u>JSON Syntax is able to return JavaScript Notation, hence the name.</u></p> 
<p id="Data(1)"></p>
<script>
var myObj, x, y, z;
myObj = { Name: "Francys Cunanan", Age: 23, City: "Beaumont" };
x = myObj.Name;
y = myObj.Age;
z = myObj.City;
document.getElementById("Data(1)").innerHTML = x + "'s place is " + z + " (inside the code, var 'y' is left out intentionally).";
</script>

<p><u>You are also able to modify the notations with JSON.</u></p> 
<p id="Data(2)"></p>
<script>
var student;
student = { ID: "005307350", Month: 6, Year: 6 };

student["Year"] = 1997;
document.getElementById("Data(2)").innerHTML = "Student " + student.ID + "'s birth year is " + student.Year + " (inside the code, student.Year has been modified).";
</script>

	<br><br>
    	<b>JSON</b> stands for 
    	<b><i>J</i></b>ava 
	<b><i>S</i></b>cript 
    	<b><i>O</i></b>bject 
    	<b><i>N</i></b>otation.
	<br>
	It is a language independent text format that holds the following data types:
	<br><br>
	String
	<br>
	Number
	<br>
	Boolean Function
	<br>
	Array (ordered list of differing values) and
	<br>
	Object (unordered list of various values i.e. name types).
	<br><br>
	Since this is relatively easy to read for both humans and computers, it can be used to transfer data onto servers, webs, or mobile applications. 
	It costs very little memory in comparison to XML. 
	Another thing to note is that -- from apparent understanding -- JSON format only benefits upon converting information, 
	but it's not able to modify or add anything with HTML elements.
	Basically, it's read-only.
