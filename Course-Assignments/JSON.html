	<br><br>
    	<b>JSON</b> stands for 
    	<b><i>J</i></b>ava 
	<b><i>S</i></b>cript 
    	<b><i>O</i></b>bject 
    	<b><i>N</i></b>otation.
	<br>
	It is a language independent text format that holds the following data types:
	<br><br>
	String
	<br>
	Number
	<br>
	Boolean Function
	<br>
	Array (ordered list of differing values) and
	<br>
	Object (unordered list of various values i.e. name types).
	<br><br>
Since this is relatively easy to read for both humans and computers, it can be used to transfer data onto servers, webs, or mobile applications. 
It costs very little memory in comparison to XML. 
Another thing to note is that -- from apparent understanding -- JSON format only benefits upon converting information, 
but it's not able to modify or add anything with HTML elements.
Basically, it's read-only.
